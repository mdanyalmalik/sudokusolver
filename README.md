# sudokusolver

This is a sudoku solver I made using Python and PyGame. It is inspired by the youtuber, TechWithTim's version of this.
The backtracking algorithm is used to solve it and the primary purpose of the program is to visualise how this algorithm solves the board.

Usage:
Once on the board, click to select a square and press a number on the keyboard to start solving manually.
To solve the board automatically, press Space to solve it and show the animation, whereas, pressing S will solve it instantly without showing the animation.
(if the animation is taking too long, you can skip it by pressing and holding S)
Pressing the escape key will take you back to the start menu.
